#IsomorphicGraphs

##APPROACH

>To solve for isomorphic graphs, the program has to prove that 2 graphs
are the same or different. This problem falls under the p v np problems as it can't be solved under a sufficent amount of time. However currently
the best way to look at the problem and solve it within a resonibile time
is to solve that they are not the same graph.

##Solving difference

>The fastest approach found for me was the idea that both graphs do not contain either:
-more nodes than the other
-have more connections than the other
-do not have the same ammount of degrees per nodes
